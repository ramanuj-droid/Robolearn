Overview — What it does

A backend service that ingests a user’s current skills, goals, constraints (time per week, target role, preferred formats),
and returns a personalized learning roadmap (topics, order, estimated time, resources, checkpoints, quizzes).
The AI (LLM) composes the roadmap; the backend handles user profiles, storage, orchestration, caching, analytics, and integrations (Coursera, YouTube, GitHub, etc).

Core features (MVP → Advanced)
MVP

1. User Registration & Login
Secure sign-up and login system.
Password hashing using bcrypt.
JWT token-based authentication to protect routes.

2. Skill Assessment Form
Simple HTML form where users input:
Current skills.
Career goals.
Preferred learning pace (daily/weekly hours).
Sends data to backend via JSON request.

3. AI-Powered Roadmap Generation

Backend calls an AI API (e.g., OpenAI) with user’s skill data.
AI creates a custom step-by-step learning path.
Includes: Topics, sequence, difficulty progression, and estimated completion time.

4. Roadmap Storage & Retrieval

Save generated roadmaps in MongoDB.
Each roadmap linked to the specific user account.
Users can retrieve and view old roadmaps anytime.

5. Roadmap Editing & Regeneration

User can tweak roadmap parameters (goal, hours/week, skill focus).
AI regenerates a new improved plan without losing old ones.

6. Export & Sharing

Option to export roadmap as PDF or JSON file.
Option to share a public link (read-only) with friends.

7. Progress Tracking (Optional MVP+ Feature)

User marks topics as completed.
AI updates the roadmap dynamically.

8. Admin Dashboard

View all registered users.
Check how many roadmaps generated.
Option to delete or block users.

9. Deployment with Docker & Cloud

App containerized with Docker.
Deployment on free-tier cloud (Render, Railway, or Fly.io).

10. Security & Rate Limiting
JWT for authentication.

Helmet.js for securing HTTP headers.
Limit roadmap requests per user per day.




*v1 (useful product)

Multi-step roadmaps (modules, lessons, exercises).
Resource linking (YouTube, docs, courses) — scraped or API-provided.
Progress tracking and simple quiz generator for checkpoints.
Versioning & edit history for roadmaps.

Rate-limiting, caching, user auth (JWT).

*v2 (advanced)

Adaptive updates: roadmap adjusts based on quiz results and progress.
Collaborative features: share roadmaps, mentor review.
Multi-modal inputs: GitHub repo analysis / CV upload to auto-detect skills.
A/B testing different curricula and measuring outcomes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monetization: premium/paid curated paths, API access for enterprises.

High-level architecture
Frontend (React/Next.js) — profile UI, roadmap viewer, quizzes.
Backend API (FastAPI / NestJS) — auth, orchestration, DB.
LLM Service (OpenAI / Anthropic / local Llama2/GPT-J) — roadmap generation & QA.
Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) — store resource embeddings for semantic search.
Relational DB (Postgres) — users, roadmap metadata, progress.
Worker queue (Celery/RabbitMQ or RQ) — async tasks (generate, fetch resources, quizzes).
Caching (Redis) — rate-limits, generated items cache.
Integrations: OAuth for GitHub, APIs for course platforms.


Data model (simplified)

User
id, name, email, role, weekly_hours, target_role, deadline, created_at

Skill
id, name, level (0–5), last_used

Roadmap
id, user_id, title, goal, created_at, updated_at, status

Module
id, roadmap_id, order, title, est_hours, description

Lesson
id, module_id, order, title, est_minutes, resources[], quiz_id (optional)

Resource
id, type (video/article/course), url, title, difficulty, trust_score, embedding

Progress
user_id, roadmap_id, lesson_id, status (not_started/in_progress/done), score

API endpoints (examples)
POST /api/v1/roadmaps/generate

Body:


{
  "user_id": "u123",
  "current_skills": [{"name":"Python","level":3},{"name":"SQL","level":2}],
  "target_role":"Data Scientist",
  "weekly_hours":8,
  "deadline":"2025-11-01",
  "preferred_formats":["video","interactive"],
  "constraints":{"budget_per_month":30}
}
Response: roadmap_id + summary

GET /api/v1/roadmaps/{id} → full roadmap JSON
POST /api/v1/roadmaps/{id}/feedback → adapt roadmap
POST /api/v1/upload/github → analyze repo for skill inference
LLM prompt design (templates)
Use a structured prompt + few-shot examples. Keep system message precise and include constraints (word counts, time estimates).

System:

You are a professional learning-path architect. Produce structured JSON containing modules, lessons, estimations, and resources. Preserve user constraints. Use concise titles.
User (input + instruction):


User profile:
- Current skills: Python (3/5), SQL (2/5)
- Target role: Data Scientist (entry-level)
- Weekly hours: 8
- Deadline: 2025-11-01 (12 weeks)
- Preferred formats: video, interactive
- Budget: $30/month

Task: Produce a 12-week roadmap divided into modules (weeks), each week contains topics, learning goals, lessons (with 1-3 resources) and estimated hours. Output strictly as JSON with keys: roadmap_title, total_weeks, modules:[{week, title, est_hours, lessons:[{title, minutes, resources:[{title,url,type}]},...]}]. Ensure beginner-friendly sequencing and one weekly checkpoint quiz.
Few-shot example snippet (short) can be added to improve structure.

Resource pipeline
Option A: Curate resource database manually + embeddings for semantic matching.
Option B: On-demand web search (scrape trusted sources: YouTube, freeCodeCamp, official docs) — backend fetches, rates and caches resources, then LLM selects best links.
Store resource metadata + embedding for future reuse.

Quiz & assessment
Generate short MCQs or coding tasks per checkpoint via LLM.
Auto-grade objective MCQs; for coding tasks, run tests in sandboxed container (Docker) or use unit-test harness (careful w/ security).
Use quiz performance to adapt pacing/contents.
Adaptivity rules (simple)
If user scores < 60% on a checkpoint, insert a remediation module (extra practice + alternate resources).
If user completes early or scores >90% consistently, accelerate roadmap (compress weeks).

Caching, costs & safety
Cache LLM outputs for same input to save costs.

Rate-limit generation; use async workers and queue.
Sanitize and validate all external resource URLs.
Sensitive data: don't log PII; offer option to delete user data.
Evaluation metrics
User engagement: lessons completed / week.

Accuracy of skill inference (compare declared vs detected).

Learning outcomes: checkpoint pass rates.
Time-to-goal completion.
User satisfaction (NPS).
Tech stack suggestion (practical)
Backend: FastAPI (Python) or NestJS (TypeScript)
